# Data science job market analysis
This project is one of my first toy projects. Its main goals are:  
- to get hands-on experience on getting the real-world data using web scraping  
- trying to process and analyze real-world data  
- to provide more understanding of what the data science job market in Russia is as of 2022 end  
- probably to find vacancies suitable for me ;)
